# Added public PGP key email to website

Hi all. I've added my public PGP key to the files section of this website. It's linked to my main e-mail address (hello[at]timokats[dot]xyz).  

[audio/mpeg](https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/producer/koresoundpack/fm8transientattacks/audio/1_FM8ROXXS.mp3)

Note, for me it's not a hard requirement to use it when sending me an email. In fact, it's mainly there for those that prefer/require encrypted correspondence when contacting me. 

Timo

And here goes some text...

- hello
  - some indendation
- hello again
* other things

And back to text again
